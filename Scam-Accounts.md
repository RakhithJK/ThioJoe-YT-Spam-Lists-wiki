## What Is Meant By "Scam Accounts"
* For the purpose of the spam list, a 'scam account' is a username for another social media site (usually Whatsapp, Instagram and Telegram, but also email addresses) that a spam comments tells you to contact
   * **NOTE:** Please note the difference between the "_scam account_" category and "spam thread" category. Yes, spam threads do mention spam accounts, but I want to separate those for future purposes and features
* They come in a wide variety, but seem to most often be for fake hacking services

## Notes Before Submitting
   * Of course, NEVER contact scammers, and never reply to spam comments, because sometimes you can get caught as a false positive
   * Try to only submit scam accounts from comments that aren't very old (within the past couple). Many of these accounts become abandoned or get suspended after a while, so it really only makes sense to add accounts known to be active
   * Don't worry about submitting any phone numbers, they should already get caught by the program's existing spam filters
