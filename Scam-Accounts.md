## What Is Meant By "Scam Accounts"
* For the purpose of the spam list, a 'scam account' is a username for another social media site (usually Whatsapp, Instagram and Telegram, but also email addresses) that a spam comments tells you to contact
   * **NOTE:** Please note the difference between the "_scam account_" category and "scam thread" category. Yes, spam threads do mention spam accounts, but I want to separate those for future purposes and features
* They come in a wide variety, but seem to most often be for fake hacking services
* By scam accounts, I don't mean the usernames of bots leaving spam comments, but the external account usernames they are advertising
   * Note: Many times bots will put the external username in their own channel name itself (to get around comment filters), then direct you to 'visit the person in my profile' or whatever, or have upward pointing arrows. In this case, submit only the external username they are advertising.

## Notes Before Submitting
   * Of course, NEVER contact scammers, and never reply to spam comments, because sometimes you can get caught as a false positive
   * Try to only submit scam accounts from comments that aren't very old (within the past couple). Many of these accounts become abandoned or get suspended after a while, so it really only makes sense to add accounts known to be active
   * Don't worry about submitting any phone numbers, they should already get caught by the program's existing spam filters
