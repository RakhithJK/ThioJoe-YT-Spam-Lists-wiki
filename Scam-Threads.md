## What Is Meant By "Scam Threads"
* A scam thread / spam thread is the name I chose for a type of scam in which one fake bot will leave a top-level comment, then many other bots will pretend to be interested users, and eventually the bots will leave comments recommending some account or person to contact (a scammer).
* Usually these threads are 'investing' or 'trading' related, where multiple fake bots will talk about how much money they've made because of some 'expert investor', and recommend them
   * The scammer often creates a fake alias / name, and multiple bots will mention this name. However, only a couple comments (or even maybe one) may will mention the actual account used to contact this scammer.
   * The threads may or may not mention cryptocurrency

## Notes Before Submitting
* As always, **never** contact or reply to these scammers
* Even though the usernames mentioned in these scam threads could be considered 'scam accounts' by my other definition, only submit these kinds of threads to this category.  I want to differentiate them so I can handle them differently than other comment types.
* In your submission, try to include all the variations of the scam name used, plus the actual social media handle
   * Some examples of variations used: "Mrs Jane Doe Smith", "Ms Jane Doe Smith", "Jane Doe Smith", "janesmithzzz" (username example)
   * Don't include the usernames of the fake bot commenters themselves, unless the scam account name is put into the bot's username (such as a bot leaving a comment that says 'contact the person in my username', or using upwards pointing emojis or whatever)
* Stick to scam threads that are being used in relatively recent comments (within the past few weeks). Very old accounts may be abandoned or banned already.
