## What Is Meant By "Spam Domains"
* Spam domains are rather self-explanatory. Spammers of various types will leave a spam comment directing you to a particular domain.
* Some common examples types of spam comments with spam domain links: Porn bots, free Robux/Vbucks scams, cd key / keygen scams, etc

## Notes Before Submitting
* **NEVER** visit the spam domains. At best they are scams advertising something sketchy, and at worst they could contain malicious code.
   * Also, never reply to spam comments, because sometimes you can get caught as a false positive.
* If the mentioned domains have a sub-domain, that's fine, just submit the whole thing
* If the comment is old (a few weeks+), before submitting please try using [this website](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/) ("[DownForEveryoneOrJustMe.com](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/)") to check if the domain is still up and running. Many of these domains are only used for a short time before being abandoned, because they get flagged as malicious.
   * But remember: **DO NOT VISIT THE DOMAIN YOURSELF**. Have that site check for you.
