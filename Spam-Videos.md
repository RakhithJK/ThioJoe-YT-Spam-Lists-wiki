## What Is Meant By "Spam Videos"
* When a spammer posts the link to a YouTube video in a comment.
* If you see 'ID' mentioned, I mean the spam video ID - see the outlines in the examples below
* A common example of these types of spam comments include only the text "Finally it's here" along with the link.

## Notes Before Submitting
* Avoid clicking the links to prevent the algorithm from thinking the video is popular
* You can copy and paste the whole link, or just the ID portion of the link
